This is my master degree diploma work, defended with best mark in 2015.
In short this is flight simulator over computer generated ladnscape.

In details my main focus here was to design an algorithm which can generate terrain landscapes on multiple threads.
The flight simulator and physics behind it was just an addition to project.
